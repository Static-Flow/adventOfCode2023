# Day 6 Part 2:

## Sample Input:
```
Time:      71530
Distance:  940200
```

## Algorithm Overview
<details>
  <summary>Spoiler warning</summary>

    For day 6 it's about finding the number of possible wins between a race time and distance
    
    Part 2 is just a bigger number by compressing the races down into 1 long one. Algo is the same as part 1 but just takes longer. 

    There's a neat solution using quadratic equations but I hadn't thought of that and already checked reddit so trying to optimize would be 
    cheating at this point so I implemented it but am not counting it.

## Performance (AVG. Per Line):
```
Run Time [ using now:=time.Now() //do_work print(time.Since(now) ]: 4 ms
```
